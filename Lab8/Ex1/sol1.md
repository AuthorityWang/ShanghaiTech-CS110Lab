# Scenario 1:

# 1. What combination of parameters is producing the hit rate you observe? (Hint: Your answer should be the process of your calculation.)

hit rate = 0.75, as 
# 2. What is our hit rate if we increase Rep Count arbitrarily? Why?

# 3.How could we modify our program parameters to maximize our hit rate?
